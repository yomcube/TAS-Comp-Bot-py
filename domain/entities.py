Domain Entities
===============

Module path:

Summary:
    Core domain entities representing tasks, users, teams, submissions,
    and speed‑task sessions, along with related value objects.

Responsibilities:
    - Task: competition with lifecycle methods (open, publish, close)
    - SpeedTaskSession: individual user session for a speed-task
    - SubmissionFile, RKGFile, RKSysFile: file metadata value objects
    - User: Discord user
    - Team: group of users who collaborate in a task
    - Submission: run submission tied to a task, user/team, and file
