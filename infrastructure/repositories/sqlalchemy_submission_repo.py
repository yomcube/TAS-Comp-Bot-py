SQLAlchemy Submission Repository
================================

Module path:
    src/infrastructure/repositories/sqlalchemy_submission_repo.py

Summary:
    Async SQLAlchemy implementation of the SubmissionRepository interface.

Responsibilities:
    - add(sub): insert a Submission (solo or team)
    - save(sub): save a submission with a modified state (example: editing a time)
    - remove_user_submissions(task_id, user_id): delete submissions for a solo user
    - remove_team_submissions(task_id, team_id): delete submission for a team
    - get_submission_by_user(task_id, user_id): load a solo submission
    - get_submission_by_team(task_id, team_id): load a team submission
    - get_submissions(task_id): list all submissions for a task
    - clear_all(): delete all submissions (after a competition)
