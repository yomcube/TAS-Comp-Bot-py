Collaborative Team Invite Command
=================================

Module path:
    src/adapters/discord/commands/comp/collab_command.py

Summary:
    Provides a `/collab` command that lets a user invite one or more members to
    join (or form) a team. Each invitee gets an interactive message with
    Accept / Decline buttons; the inviter can also Cancel. When all invitees
    have answered (or the view times out), the service either creates the team
    or adds accepted members to the inviter's existing team.

Responsibilities:
    - Validate that a team competition is active.
    - Prevent self-invites and inviting users already in a team.
    - Enforce the team size limit.
    - Track invite decisions per inviter until all invitees respond (or timeout).
    - Call TeamService to create a team or add members accordingly.
