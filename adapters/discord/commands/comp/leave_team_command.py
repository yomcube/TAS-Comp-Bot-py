Leave Team Command
==================

Module path:
    src/adapters/discord/commands/comp/leave_team_command.py

Summary:
    Lets a member leave their current team. If the team would drop to a single
    member after the departure, the team is dissolved.

Responsibilities:
    - Validate that a competition is configured and a task is ongoing.
    - Ensure the task is a team collab task.
    - Find the caller's team and:
        • Dissolve it if it would fall to one member, or
        • Remove the caller from the team otherwise.
    - Refresh the public "Current Submissions" message.
