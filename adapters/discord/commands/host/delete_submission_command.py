Delete Submission Command
=========================

Module path:
    src/adapters/discord/commands/host/delete_submission_command.py

Summary:
    Host-only hybrid command that removes a competitor’s submission (solo or team),
    refreshes the public submission list, and strips the “submitted” role from the
    affected user(s).

Responsibilities:
    - Validate that a competition is configured for the guild.
    - Resolve the active task or, if none, the last task.
    - Delegate deletion to SubmissionService.remove_submission.
    - Refresh the public “Current Submissions” message.
    - Remove the configured “submitted” role from the user or the whole team.
