Get Submissions Command
=======================

Module path:
    src/adapters/discord/commands/host/get_submissions_command.py

Summary:
    Host-only command that lists submissions for the active task
    or the most recent task if it is past deadline. Discord's 2000
    characters limit is taken into account.

Responsibilities:
    - Resolve the active task (fallback to the last task if it's past deadline).
    - Fetch all submissions for that task via SubmissionService.
    - Split output into multiple messages under Discord size limits.
